# How the `fear factor' spreads across the global financial markets

This code repository belongs to an upcoming thesis. Our interest targets Implied Volatility data and the relationships of this indicator between different countries. Since this measure is often used to capture the market’s sentiment towards the volatility of a particular asset, it is also referred to as the “fear factor”. 

The underlying thesis describes how agents can learn from data through probability theory by reformulating the task as exact inference and maximum likelihood. We focus on learning Bayesian networks and show why they provide optimal predictions, solutions to overfitting and how they even handle decision making with incomplete data. And since Bayesian networks provide the potential for causal interpretations, we conclude with causal discovery. This excerpt serves as a summary of the application results and the approach we propose is structured as follows: First, we discuss the terminology of financial markets and then analyse and process our raw data. After learning our Bayesian networks, we validate their predictive properties and compare them appropriately. Finally we apply methods of causal discovery to infer the actual impact of countries.
