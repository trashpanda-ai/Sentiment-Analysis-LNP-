# Natural language processing (NLP): Sentiment Analysis on Financial News
Sentiment Analysis with VADER and pysentiment  on news headlines, and design of MySQL database with a time series on respective daily sentiments scores. 
Will be used as an additional KPI for Risk Management in (Algo)Trading to support calculation of confidence intervals and thresholds before the markets open. 
(First, it should be tested and validated  with at least several months of data)


### Motivation
>"There are three ways to make a living in this business: be first, be smarter, or cheat. Well, I don't cheat. And although I like to think we have some pretty smart people here in this room, it sure is a hell of lot easier to just be first." - Margin Call

But to be the first to use market data, you would need to be in an optimal physical location (depending on the stock exchanges) and you have to have the fastest connection. Neither of those is true for me and many others. So to be successful - in this analogy of margin call - you would have to design/manipulate a unique set of data - and therefore be first again.
